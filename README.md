# Go email sender

This project is a simple prove of concept of how to send emails using Go.

## Service providers

In this project I used three different service providers to send emails:

- [net/smtp](https://pkg.go.dev/net/smtp)
- [Gomail](https://pkg.go.dev/gopkg.in/gomail.v2)
- [SendGrid](https://sendgrid.com/en-us)
